## Article ID: EXT_2-11-2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> No-delay condition. Results in the no-delay conditionpointed to substantial retroactive interference, which wasconfirmed by a 2 (phase: 1 vs. 3) × 2 (pair type: overlappingvs. unique) repeated measures analysis of variance(ANOVA), which revealed a significant interaction, F(1,24) = 13.04, p = .001, ηp2 = .35. Planned comparisonsindicated that accuracy significantly decreased for overlappingpairs, t(24) = 6.82, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.39, butnot for unique pairs, p = .46.To determine the extent of retroactive interference effects on children’s memory, we also measured savingseffects. Results pointed to savings for unique but not foroverlapping pairs: A 2 (phase: 1 vs. 3) × 2 (pair type:overlapping vs. unique) repeated measures ANOVArevealed a significant interaction, F(1, 22) = 12.02, p =.002, ηp2 = .33, with savings transpiring for unique pairs, t(24) = 5.82, p < .001, d = 1.19, but not for overlappingpairs, p = .56. Substantial retroactive interference coupledwith no savings for overlapping pairs points to catastrophic-like levels of retroactive interference, whichreplicates our previous findings (Darby & Sloutsky,2015).
